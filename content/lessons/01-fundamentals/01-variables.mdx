# Variables in C#

Variables are containers for storing data values. In C#, every variable has a specific type that determines what kind of data it can hold.

## Declaring Variables

In C#, you declare a variable by specifying its type followed by its name:

```csharp
int age;
string name;
double price;
bool isActive;
```

## Initializing Variables

You can assign a value to a variable when you declare it or later:

```csharp
int age = 25;
string name = "John";
double price = 19.99;
bool isActive = true;
```

## Variable Naming Rules

- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, digits, and underscores
- Cannot use C# keywords
- Case-sensitive (age and Age are different variables)

**Good variable names:**
```csharp
firstName
_privateVariable
userCount
totalPrice
```

**Bad variable names:**
```csharp
123name     // Cannot start with a number
my-var      // Hyphens not allowed
class       // Reserved keyword
```

## Type Inference with `var`

C# can automatically infer the type of a variable using the `var` keyword:

```csharp
var age = 25;            // Compiler infers int
var name = "John";       // Compiler infers string
var price = 19.99;       // Compiler infers double
var isActive = true;     // Compiler infers bool
```

Note: `var` can only be used when the type can be inferred from the initial value.

## Key Takeaways

- Variables must be declared with a type before use
- Variable names should be meaningful and follow naming conventions
- Use `var` for type inference when the type is obvious
- C# is strongly-typed, meaning types are checked at compile time

## Practice

Try declaring variables for the following scenarios:
1. A person's age (whole number)
2. A product name (text)
3. A price with decimal places
4. Whether a user is logged in (yes/no)

In the next lesson, we'll explore different data types in detail!
