# Testing Project Overview: Task Manager API

Throughout this testing section, we'll work with a real-world C# project: **Task Manager API**. This comprehensive RESTful API will serve as our testing playground, allowing you to learn both manual and automated testing techniques on actual code.

## Why a Real Project?

Testing theory is important, but nothing beats hands-on experience with real code. By using the Task Manager API, you'll:

- **Learn by doing** with actual business logic
- **See realistic scenarios** that you'll encounter in production
- **Understand the value** of different testing approaches
- **Build practical skills** you can apply immediately

## 📥 Getting the Project

The Task Manager API is included in your course materials. Here's how to access it:

### Option 1: Course Materials (Recommended)

If you're viewing this lesson, the project is already available:

```bash
# The project is located in your course directory
cd sample-projects/TaskManagerAPI

# Verify it's there
ls
```

You should see:
- `TaskManagerAPI.csproj` - Main project file
- `Controllers/` - API endpoints
- `Services/` - Business logic
- `Models/` - Data models
- And more...

### Option 2: Download from GitHub

The project is also available on GitHub:

**Repository**: `https://github.com/vtpqui3009/e-learning`

```bash
# Clone the entire course repository
git clone https://github.com/vtpqui3009/e-learning.git

# Navigate to the Task Manager API
cd e-learning/sample-projects/TaskManagerAPI
```

### Option 3: Download ZIP

1. Go to the course repository on GitHub
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select "Download ZIP"
4. Extract to your preferred location
5. Navigate to `sample-projects/TaskManagerAPI/`

### Verify Your Download

Check that you have all the files:

```bash
cd sample-projects/TaskManagerAPI
ls -la
```

You should see:
```
TaskManagerAPI/
├── Controllers/
├── Services/
├── Models/
├── DTOs/
├── Data/
├── TaskManagerAPI.csproj
├── Program.cs
├── appsettings.json
└── README.md

TaskManagerAPI.Tests/
├── Services/
├── Controllers/
└── TaskManagerAPI.Tests.csproj
```

### Quick Test

Make sure .NET 8.0 is installed:

```bash
dotnet --version
# Should show 8.0 or higher
```

Then run the project:

```bash
cd TaskManagerAPI
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

If you see:
```
Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
Application started.
```

**You're all set!** 🎉

Open `https://localhost:5001` in your browser to see the Swagger UI.

## Project Overview

The Task Manager API is a complete RESTful API for managing tasks, users, and categories. It includes:

### Core Features

```csharp
public class TaskItem
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string? Description { get; set; }
    public TaskStatus Status { get; set; }
    public TaskPriority Priority { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DueDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime? CompletedAt { get; set; }
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public int? CategoryId { get; set; }
}
```

### Status Workflow

Tasks follow a defined workflow with validation:

```
Todo ──────────┐
  │            │
  ├─> InProgress ──> Done
  │            │
  └──> Cancelled
```

Valid transitions are enforced:
- **Todo** → InProgress, Cancelled
- **InProgress** → Done, Todo, Cancelled
- **Done** → InProgress
- **Cancelled** → Todo

### Priority Levels

```csharp
public enum TaskPriority
{
    Low,
    Medium,
    High,
    Critical
}
```

## What Makes This Project Ideal for Testing?

### 1. Business Logic to Test

The project includes realistic business rules:

```csharp
// Validation: Due date cannot be in the past
if (request.DueDate.HasValue && request.DueDate.Value < DateTime.UtcNow.Date)
    throw new ArgumentException("Due date cannot be in the past");

// Validation: Title is required and has length limits
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(request.Title))
    throw new ArgumentException("Task title is required");

if (request.Title.Length > 200)
    throw new ArgumentException("Task title cannot exceed 200 characters");
```

### 2. Multiple Testing Levels

You can test at different levels:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints end-to-end
- **Manual Tests**: Use Postman/Swagger to verify behavior

### 3. Real-World Scenarios

The project demonstrates common patterns:
- **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Data validation** (required fields, data types)
- **Business rules** (status transitions, date validations)
- **Relationships** (tasks belong to users and categories)
- **Error handling** (appropriate HTTP status codes)

## API Endpoints

The API provides these endpoints for testing:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/tasks` | Get all tasks (with filters) |
| GET | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Get specific task |
| POST | `/api/tasks` | Create new task |
| PUT | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Update task |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Delete task |
| PATCH | `/api/tasks/{id}/status` | Update status |
| GET | `/api/tasks/statistics/{userId}` | Get statistics |
| GET | `/api/tasks/overdue` | Get overdue tasks |

## Getting Started with the Project

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** or later
- A code editor (**Visual Studio**, **VS Code**, or **Rider**)
- Optional: **Postman** or similar tool for manual testing

### Running the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd sample-projects/TaskManagerAPI
```

2. Restore dependencies:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

3. Run the API:
```bash
dotnet run
```

4. Access Swagger UI:
```
Open: https://localhost:5001
```

### Running the Tests

```bash
cd sample-projects/TaskManagerAPI.Tests
dotnet test
```

## Sample Data

The project comes with seeded data for testing:

**Users:**
- John Doe (ID: 1)
- Jane Smith (ID: 2)

**Categories:**
- Work (ID: 1)
- Personal (ID: 2)
- Shopping (ID: 3)

**Tasks:**
- "Complete project documentation" (InProgress, High priority)
- "Buy groceries" (Todo, Medium priority)
- "Review pull requests" (Done, High priority)

## What You'll Learn

Throughout the testing lessons, you'll use this project to learn:

### Manual Testing
- Testing API endpoints with Postman and Swagger
- Verifying status codes and responses
- Testing validation rules
- Exploring edge cases
- Documenting test cases

### Automated Testing
- Writing unit tests with xUnit
- Testing business logic in isolation
- Using Moq for mocking dependencies
- Writing integration tests
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Code coverage analysis

## Business Rules to Test

The project implements several business rules that need testing:

1. **Task Creation**
   - Title is required
   - Title cannot exceed 200 characters
   - User must exist
   - Category must exist (if provided)
   - Due date cannot be in the past

2. **Task Updates**
   - Status transitions must be valid
   - Due date cannot be changed to past
   - Category must exist (if changing)

3. **Status Management**
   - Completing a task sets `CompletedAt`
   - Invalid transitions are rejected
   - Status workflow is enforced

4. **Statistics**
   - Counts are accurate
   - Overdue tasks are correctly identified
   - Per-user filtering works

## Next Steps

In the following lessons, you'll:

1. **Explore** the project and understand its structure
2. **Test manually** using Swagger and Postman
3. **Write unit tests** for business logic
4. **Create integration tests** for API endpoints
5. **Learn testing patterns** and best practices
6. **Measure code coverage** and improve it
7. **Apply TDD** to add new features

## Try It Now!

Before moving to the next lesson, try running the API:

```bash
cd sample-projects/TaskManagerAPI
dotnet run
```

Then open your browser to `https://localhost:5001` and explore the Swagger UI. Try creating a task, updating its status, and deleting it. Get familiar with the API—you'll be testing it extensively in the upcoming lessons!

## Summary

- ✅ Real business logic and validations
- ✅ Multiple testing levels (unit, integration, manual)
- ✅ Realistic scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ Complete test suite to learn from
- ✅ Hands-on practice with actual code

In the next lesson, we'll dive into **Introduction to Testing** where you'll learn the fundamental concepts and why testing is crucial for software quality.
