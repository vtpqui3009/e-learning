# Introduction to Testing

Welcome to Test Automation with C#! This course will teach you how to write automated tests, even if you've only done manual testing before.

## Prerequisites

This lesson is perfect for complete beginners! You don't need any C# knowledge to understand testing concepts.

**What you need:**
- ✅ Interest in software testing
- ✅ Basic understanding of what software does

**Optional (helpful but not required):**
- Manual testing experience
- Basic programming concepts

⏱️ **If starting from scratch:** You can start right here!

## What is Automated Testing?

Automated testing means writing code that tests other code. Instead of manually clicking buttons and checking results, you write test scripts that do it automatically.

**Manual Testing** (what you might be doing now):
1. Open the application
2. Click a button
3. Enter some data
4. Check if the result is correct
5. Repeat for every feature... every time!

**Automated Testing** (what you'll learn):
1. Write a test script once
2. Run it automatically
3. Get results in seconds
4. Run thousands of tests in minutes

## Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests
Test individual methods or classes in isolation.

**Example**: Testing if a calculator's Add method works correctly.

<CodeEditor
  initialCode={`using System;

// The code we want to test
class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// Simple test (we'll make this better later!)
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var calc = new Calculator();
        int result = calc.Add(5, 3);

        if (result == 8)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("✓ Test PASSED: Add(5, 3) = 8");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"✗ Test FAILED: Expected 8, got {result}");
        }
    }
}`}
/>

### 2. Integration Tests
Test how different parts of your application work together.

**Example**: Testing if your code can save data to a database and retrieve it correctly.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
Test the entire application from start to finish.

**Example**: Testing a complete user registration flow from opening the app to receiving a confirmation email.

### 4. API Tests
Test web services and APIs.

**Example**: Testing if your REST API returns the correct data when you send a request.

## Why Learn C# for Testing?

✅ **Industry Standard**: Many companies use C# for test automation
✅ **Great for .NET Apps**: Perfect for testing .NET applications
✅ **Powerful Tools**: Excellent testing frameworks (xUnit, NUnit, MSTest)
✅ **Career Growth**: High demand for C# test automation engineers
✅ **Versatile**: Can test APIs, desktop apps, and web applications

## Real-World Testing Example

Let's see a real example of why automated tests are valuable:

<CodeEditor
  initialCode={`using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// A shopping cart class that we need to test
class ShoppingCart
{
    private List<decimal> items = new List<decimal>();

    public void AddItem(decimal price)
    {
        if (price <= 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Price must be positive");
        }
        items.Add(price);
    }

    public decimal GetTotal()
    {
        decimal total = 0;
        foreach (var price in items)
        {
            total += price;
        }
        return total;
    }

    public int GetItemCount()
    {
        return items.Count;
    }
}

// Manual testing (tedious and error-prone)
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("=== Manual Testing ===\\n");

        var cart = new ShoppingCart();

        // Test 1: Adding items
        cart.AddItem(10.99m);
        cart.AddItem(5.50m);
        cart.AddItem(3.25m);

        decimal total = cart.GetTotal();
        int count = cart.GetItemCount();

        Console.WriteLine($"Items: {count}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Total: ${'{'}total{'}'}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Expected total: $19.74");

        if (total == 19.74m)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("✓ Total calculation PASSED");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("✗ Total calculation FAILED");
        }

        // Test 2: Testing negative price
        Console.WriteLine("\\n=== Testing Negative Price ===");
        try
        {
            cart.AddItem(-5.00m);
            Console.WriteLine("✗ Should have thrown exception!");
        }
        catch (ArgumentException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("✓ Correctly rejected negative price");
        }

        Console.WriteLine("\\nImagine doing this for 100+ features... manually... every time!");
    }
}`}
/>

**Problems with manual testing:**
- ❌ Time-consuming (minutes per test)
- ❌ Error-prone (humans make mistakes)
- ❌ Can't test every scenario every time
- ❌ Boring and repetitive
- ❌ Hard to test edge cases

**Benefits of automated testing:**
- ✅ Fast (thousands of tests in seconds)
- ✅ Consistent (same test every time)
- ✅ Comprehensive (test all scenarios)
- ✅ Instant feedback (know immediately if something broke)
- ✅ Confidence (refactor code safely)

## The Testing Mindset

As a manual tester transitioning to automation, you already have valuable skills:

**Your Manual Testing Skills:**
- ✓ Finding bugs
- ✓ Understanding user workflows
- ✓ Thinking about edge cases
- ✓ Writing test cases

**What You'll Add:**
- ✓ Writing test code
- ✓ Using testing frameworks
- ✓ Automating repetitive tests
- ✓ Integrating tests into CI/CD

You're not replacing your testing skills—you're supercharging them!

## What Makes a Good Test?

A good automated test should be:

1. **Fast**: Runs in milliseconds, not minutes
2. **Isolated**: Doesn't depend on other tests
3. **Repeatable**: Same result every time
4. **Self-checking**: Automatically determines pass/fail
5. **Clear**: Easy to understand what it's testing

### Good Test Example

<CodeEditor
  initialCode={`using System;

class StringValidator
{
    public bool IsValidEmail(string email)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(email))
            return false;

        return email.Contains("@") && email.Contains(".");
    }
}

// Good test characteristics
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var validator = new StringValidator();

        // Test 1: Valid email
        bool test1 = validator.IsValidEmail("user@example.com");
        Console.WriteLine($"Test 1 - Valid email: {(test1 ? "PASS" : "FAIL")}");

        // Test 2: Invalid email (no @)
        bool test2 = !validator.IsValidEmail("userexample.com");
        Console.WriteLine($"Test 2 - No @ symbol: {(test2 ? "PASS" : "FAIL")}");

        // Test 3: Empty string
        bool test3 = !validator.IsValidEmail("");
        Console.WriteLine($"Test 3 - Empty string: {(test3 ? "PASS" : "FAIL")}");

        // Test 4: Null value
        bool test4 = !validator.IsValidEmail(null);
        Console.WriteLine($"Test 4 - Null value: {(test4 ? "PASS" : "FAIL")}");

        Console.WriteLine("\\nAll tests completed in milliseconds!");
    }
}`}
/>

## Common Testing Terms

- **Test Case**: A single test that checks one thing
- **Test Suite**: A collection of test cases
- **Assertion**: A check that something is true
- **Test Runner**: Tool that executes tests
- **Test Framework**: Library that helps write tests (xUnit, NUnit, MSTest)
- **Mock**: A fake object used in testing
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Pattern for structuring tests

## Your Learning Project: Task Manager API

Throughout this testing section, you'll work with a **real C# project**: the Task Manager API. This is a complete RESTful API that demonstrates professional testing practices.

### What You'll Test

The Task Manager API includes:
- **Tasks** with titles, descriptions, priorities, and due dates
- **Status workflow** (Todo → InProgress → Done)
- **Validation rules** (required fields, date validation, etc.)
- **Business logic** (status transitions, overdue detection)
- **CRUD operations** via REST API

### Why a Real Project?

Instead of isolated examples, you'll:
- ✅ Test actual production-quality code
- ✅ See realistic scenarios
- ✅ Practice both manual and automated testing
- ✅ Build a professional test suite
- ✅ Apply concepts immediately

### Included in the Project

```
sample-projects/TaskManagerAPI/
├── API with 8 endpoints
├── Business logic with validations
├── 28 comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
├── Manual testing guide
└── Complete documentation
```

You'll explore this project in **Lesson 00: Project Overview** and use it throughout all testing lessons!
